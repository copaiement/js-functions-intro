# Basic JS Functions

## About
This webpage uses some of the basic JS taught in the Foundations course of TOP. The goal is to collect user input and alter it according to the user-selected function.

## Goals
* Take user input for desired function
* Take user input for value
* Display instructions for function based on selection
* Display the result of the function on input

## Thoughts
I went a little above and beyond on this one. The goal was mainly to write a few functions but I thought it would be a great exercise in functional JS on a webpage so I went this direction.
Overall it seems functional however there is no real input filtering as I didn't want to spend much more time on the assignement. Adding some simple input filters to detect invalid inputs would be necessary for something like this in a real-world setting.
One other QOL improvement would be to add a "submit" button of some kind on the input form. As-is the user has to press "return" to submit the data but there is no prompt or text telling the user to do so. Most people would figure this out but it makes sense to make the form a little more foolproof.
